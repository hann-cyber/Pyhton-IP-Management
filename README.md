# Pyhton-IP-Management
A presentation of my python automation project following Google's 'Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python' course completion.

The project is somewhat guided but the code is my own and resembles what students learn during the course.

Until the code report is posted here you can find the word doc by clicking "PythonProjectReport.docx" and clicking "raw" to download the file.
